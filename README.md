# unity-code
A set of scripts from different unity projects, to showcase my current programming ability.
PotatoSalad is the name of my First game.
One of the files contains the build of the game and the other contains the Assets folder which has my scripts, materials, prefabs, etc.

The zip files, GameJamAssets and GameJamBuild denote the assests and build of my second game respectively
This game; however, was a team project. So in the assets folder I only included the aspects of the game that I did fully by myself.
This includes the entire first level and a few transitions between menus.
I also did not create any of the models myself, but I did create all the prefabs that utilize those models.
In the full build of the game there is a credits menu denoting the people who worked on this project.
So please take a look, as they also worked very hard to make this game.
And to reconfirm, my portion of the project was the racing section with the boostpads and walls.
The scripts carMovement, sceneManager, and finishLine are the only scripts that have any relevance to the finished project.
